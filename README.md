# Under-The-Web
Under the Web" is a medium difficulty challenge on Hack The Box in the Pwn category (with a heavy Web Exploitation focus).
It is centered around the idea of exploring hidden vulnerabilities on a web server, particularly focusing on Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.
I mainly solved it through Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks, to leak files, understand the backend, possibly gain remote execution, and finally retrieve the flag.
